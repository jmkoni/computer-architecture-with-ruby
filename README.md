# Computer Architecture... with Ruby
While learning more about computer architecture, I wrote some Ruby scripts:

* MIPS Disassembler - a program that takes an array of hex or binary and translates it into MIPS instructions
* Cache Simulation - a program that takes an array or instructions, addresses, and data and updates a simulated cache. Could be altered to take user input.
